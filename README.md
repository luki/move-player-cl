# Player Move in Terminal

## Summary
A project in order to practice making terminal games using Haskell.

## Notice
This project is nearly identical to Justin's code (see _Resources_). I've
looked at his project, and coded it the way I would have. It's identical except
for a few different names and changes in how I apply methods on monads.
